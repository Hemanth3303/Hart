A game engine being built in C++ and OpenGL 4.6 <br>

## Info 
I'm making this engine as a learning exercise. As such I probably won't be accepting any pull requests.<br>
(That is if someone somehow finds this repository lol)

## Build System
CMake

## Dependencies
[glfw](https://www.glfw.org/): For Windowing, Creating OpenGL Context, Input handling, etc.
[glad](https://glad.dav1d.de/): For accessing OpenGL functions.<br>
[stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb): Specifically [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h) for loading images.<br>

## Note
Heavily inspired by the [TheCherno](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno)'s [Sparky Engine series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98fqE45g3jZA_hLGUrD4bo6_&si=7wCTJJ7dkz3_YiHU) and [Hazel Game Engine](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT&si=DDBFTAqIOJZEUX0i) series <br>
