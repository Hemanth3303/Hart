A game engine being built in C++ and OpenGL 4.6 <br>

## Info 
I'm making this engine as a learning exercise. As such I probably won't be accepting any pull requests.<br>
(That is if someone somehow finds this repository lol)

## Dependencies
[glfw](https://www.glfw.org/): For Windowing, Creating OpenGL Context, Input handling, etc. I'm using [my fork of glfw](https://github.com/Hemanth3303/glfw).<br>
[glad](https://glad.dav1d.de/): For accessing OpenGL functions.<br>
[stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb): Specifically [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h) for loading images.<br>
[premake-cmake](https://github.com/Enhex/premake-cmake): CMake generator for premake.<br>

## Note
Heavily inspired by the The Cherno's Sparky game engine series and Hazel game engine series <br>
