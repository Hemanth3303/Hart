A game engine being built in C++ and OpenGL 4.6 <br>

## Info 
I'm making this engine as a learning exercise. As such I probably won't be accepting any pull requests.<br>
(That is if someone somehow finds this repository lol)

### Note
Heavily inspired by the The Cherno's Sparky game engine series and Hazel game engine series <br>
